# TLS Stats
This is a utility that computes an estimate of TLS protocols, ciphers and curves supported by clients visiting Wikipedia.

This is intended to give an idea of how widespread support there is for a particular TLS ciphersuite, protocol and curve.

This could be useful for someone who is tasked with configuring TLS security to have an idea of what level of security their customers might be getting such that they can support the largest number of users with the best possible security those users can get.

Given the popularity of Wikipedia, this could be a good estimate. How nice would it be if Google were to publish this sort of data?
